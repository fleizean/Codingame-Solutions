The program:
You must find the sum of the mods of a list of numbers.
Modular arithmetic refers to the remainder of the divide function. A mod B = the remainder of A/B.

For example:
5 mod 2 = 1
15 mod 6 = 3

INPUT:
Line 1: An integer M describing divisor.
Line 2: The number N of values.
Line 3: A list of N numbers E separated by spaces.

OUTPUT:
A single line: The sum of numbers E mod M in the list

CONSTRAINTS:
M > 1
1 â‰¤ N < 20

EXAMPLE:

Input
3
4
4 5 8 12

Output
